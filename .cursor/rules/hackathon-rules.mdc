Build advanced strategies and hooks for the 1inch Limit Order Protocol like options, concentrated liquidity, TWAP swaps, etc. Qualification Requirements - Onchain execution of strategy should be presented during the final demo - Custom Limit Orders should not be posted to official Limit Order API - Consistent commit history should be in the GitHub project. No low or single-commit entries allowed! Stretch goals (not hard requirements) - UI Build a full Application using 1inch APIs ‚∏∫ 1inch offers a variety of REST APIs that make building onchain applications simpler. Create a full dApp using as many 1inch APIs as possible. Example integration points - Add swap functionality with one of our swap protocols (1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+), Intent-based Swap (Fusion), Classic Swap, or Limit Order protocol) - Source onchain data using our data APIs (price feeds API, wallet balances API, token metadata API, and many more) - Post transactions our Web3 API to interact with the blockchain Qualification Requirements - Application should use 1inch API as much as possible - Consistent commit history should be in the GitHub project.
