# DCA & TWAP Strategy Debug Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Storage Key Mismatch ✅
**Problem**: OrderBook was looking for `custom_twap_orders` and `custom_dca_orders` but strategies were storing with `custom_orders_twap` format.

**Fix**: Updated `lib/strategies/base-strategy.ts` to use correct storage keys:
```typescript
// OLD: `custom_orders_${strategyType.toLowerCase()}`
// NEW: `custom_${strategyType.toLowerCase()}_orders`
```

### 2. Execution Timing ✅
**Problem**: First orders were scheduled for future execution instead of immediate.

**Fix**: Set `nextExecutionTime` to past time in both strategies:
```typescript
nextExecutionTime: Date.now() - 1000 // Execute immediately
```

### 3. Missing Debugging ✅
**Problem**: No visibility into what was happening during order creation.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging throughout:
- Strategy creation parameters
- Order execution attempts  
- Storage operations with keys and data
- Verification checks after storage
- Error details with stack traces

## Testing Steps

1. **Open Browser Console** - All debug info will be logged here
2. **Create DCA Strategy**:
   - Select WETH → USDT or USDT → WETH
   - Enter amount (e.g., "0.05" for WETH or "100" for USDT)
   - Click "Create DCA Strategy"
   - Watch console logs for execution details
3. **Create TWAP Strategy**:
   - Select token pair
   - Enter total amount
   - Click "Create TWAP Strategy" 
   - Watch console logs for execution details
4. **Check Orders Page** - Should now show created orders
5. **Verify localStorage** in browser dev tools:
   - Application → Local Storage → localhost:3000
   - Look for keys: `custom_dca_orders`, `custom_twap_orders`

## Debug Logs to Look For

### DCA Strategy Creation:
```
🚀 Creating and executing DCA strategy...
📊 Strategy parameters: {fromToken, toToken, amountPerOrder...}
🔧 Initializing DCA strategy with wallet...
⚡ Executing first DCA order...
📤 Submitting DCA order to custom orderbook...
✅ Order submitted to custom DCA orderbook: order_123456
💾 Stored in localStorage with key: custom_dca_orders
📊 Order data saved: {...}
📈 Total orders in DCA storage: 1
✅ DCA order order_123456 created and submitted to custom orderbook
🔍 Verification: 1 DCA orders now in localStorage
📁 Current DCA orders in storage: 1
```

### TWAP Strategy Creation:
```
🚀 Creating and executing TWAP strategy...
📊 Strategy parameters: {fromToken, toToken, totalAmount...}
⚡ Executing first TWAP order...
📤 Submitting TWAP order to custom orderbook...
✅ Order submitted to custom TWAP orderbook: order_789012
💾 Stored in localStorage with key: custom_twap_orders
📊 Order data saved: {...}
📈 Total orders in TWAP storage: 1
✅ TWAP order order_789012 created and submitted to custom orderbook
🔍 Verification: 1 TWAP orders now in localStorage
📁 Current TWAP orders in storage: 1
```

### OrderBook Loading:
```
OrderBook: Loading custom orders...
OrderBook: Loaded orders from localStorage:
  - TWAP orders: 1
  - DCA orders: 1  
  - Options orders: 0
  - CL orders: 0
  - Total custom orders: 2
```

## Expected Results

After creating strategies, you should see:
1. Success alerts with order IDs
2. Orders appearing in the Orders page
3. Custom orders section showing: "2 orders" (or however many you created)
4. Individual order details with token pairs, amounts, and status

## If Still Not Working

Check these in browser console:
1. Any error messages during strategy creation
2. localStorage contents: `localStorage.getItem('custom_dca_orders')`
3. OrderBook debug logs showing order counts
4. Network tab for any failed API calls

The strategies now:
- ✅ Execute first order immediately 
- ✅ Store orders with correct keys
- ✅ Provide comprehensive debug logging
- ✅ Match OrderBook expectations
- ✅ Handle both WETH→USDT and USDT→WETH directions
- ✅ Convert amounts properly based on token decimals
